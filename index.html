        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      </header>

<h3><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT Experience</i></h3>
<p>The interest in IT started when I was young and started playing around with computers and playing games on laptops and PCs. From there as a I grew older my curiosity grew with me and I wanted to explore more in the IT world. My interest in IT was also a result of my father working in the IT industry as an electrical engineer. When ever he would be working on a task at home I would ask him about his work however as I grew up I realised my path in IT was more about programming and developing.</p>
<h3 class="left">Previous IT experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programming in Visual Studio/Java/HTML</li>
  <li>Fixing hardware/software on Desktops/Laptops (ie. Replacing HHD, installing Windows, Building PCs)</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></h3>
  <p>The reason I chose to go to RMIT is because it is one of the leading IT universities in the world and highly convenient to travel to from where I live. Also RMIT has been the university I had always considered ever since I was younger, Melbourne University offers limited IT courses and Monash University is extremely far to travel.</p>

  <h3><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></h3>
    <p>I expect to learn programming/coding in Java so I can apply those concepts outside of university for future jobs. I also would like to learn how to satisfy clients through adequate designs that meet their needs.
Apart from what we learn in the course itself, I would also like to learn how to be able to interact with other peers through group work which will help future job prospects. In the IT industry, high social skills are valued because most of the work done is through group collaborations.</p>

<h3>Web/App Developer</h3>

<p><a href="https://au.indeed.com/job/elearning-l1-support-e710a9b608c3cff1">Link to Job Description</a>
<div class="border">
      <img class="right" src="Job.png"></p>
			<p>This position is looking for an employee who can provide support and feedback for clients. In this case, they require employees with high understanding of Microsoft based systems and being able to problem solve issues on the client’s side. Apart from skill requirements, they are looking for individuals who bring a positive attitude and a can-do attitude.</p>
<p>This job is ideal because it offers a safe and productive work environment where it aims to improve the quality of life for teachers and students at schools through an app and website called “Compass”. Their key focus is client satisfaction which is a priority of mine when it comes to web or app development.</p>
<p>The job is looking for employees that have: a high understanding of Microsoft based technologies, troubleshooting of hardware and software on user devices, ability to train and support a broad range of users and creation and maintenance of user accounts on Active Directory.
  These skills that are required are the skills I hope to have learnt in the course to be able to help me be employed and to be able to make a difference to the users of the App and Web to help make schooling easier. Some skills can be learnt through independent learning.</p>
<p>They are also looking for employees with high energy and positive attitudes which I can provide as I am passionate about the job and being able to work with new colleagues. I am also looking to be able to work in schools especially with teachers and students to teach them about the use of Compass and how it can improve their teaching capabilities. </p>
<p>The pay and location is fitting of my ideals with the pay between $50,000 - $65,000 and the location being half an hours drive from home is also ideal. There are a team of workers who aim to deliver the best service which is an environment I personally enjoy working in.

<img src="Extraversion.png">

<img src="Neuroticism.png">

<h3><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></h3>
<p>There are similarities between the Myers-Briggs test and the Big Five Personality test with the extraversion category (sociable and outgoing) being 79% and 67% respectively. This suggests that I am willing to interact and meddle with my peers and colleagues and be flexible. My high levels of agreeableness shows that I am willing to cooperate with my peers rather than assert that my ideas are right and final. All these results portray the fact that I am ready to work with others.</p>

<h3><i>How do you think these results influence your behaviour in a team?</i></h3>
<p>Results show that although I am open and agreeable, I am an observant type therefore instead of contributing to the team at first, I am more likely to observe and listen to the others. I am also willing to speak to the team of any possible flaws in the program so that solutions can be found to fix the flaw. As well as being a visual learner, I may choose to decide to draw out the plans for the project using a mind-map to make things clearer for myself and the team.</p>

<h3><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></h3>
<p>I hope to be able to work in a team with similar qualities like myself or have different learning techniques so we can learn from one another and be productive together. On the other hand, I am also able to work with a team where someone takes charge and gives us tasks to do as working under instructions can be more efficient than working without knowing the goal.</p>

<!-- Project Idea -->
<section id="project">
  <header class="sectionHeading">
    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHATBOT</h3>
<h3 class="left">Overview</h3>
<p class="left">The project will be based on the development of an AI capable of answering users' questions. The aim is to be able to deliver better user experience in the absence of a human. The project will involve programming to create the AI whilst testing it on users to ask for user feedback on what is great about it and possible improvements on the AI. There will be a lot of collaboration with companies to deliver the best AI possible for them.</p>

<h3 class="left">Motivation</h3>
<p class="left">The project will be interesting because it will be a new experience for me personally, dealing with Artificial Intelligence. In this current technological age, we are developing technologies such as Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. A majority of companies nowadays aim to implement AI into their work environment one way or another. Being able to implement an AI in regards to FAQ users may have allows for fast and effective answers to users’ concerns.</p>

<h3 class="left">Description</h3>
<p class="left">Two main features of this service are the AI being able to have a conversation with the user and provide clear and concise information for users.</p>
<p class="left">The AI should be able to have and maintain a conversation with the user as the user may ask multiple questions about it and it is expected to be able to answer all the questions within its domain. If the chatbot was unable to maintain a conversation, it could crash and cause users to become frustrated and annoyed and it can reflect poorly on the company which uses it.</p>
<p class="left">Similarly, the AI must also be able to provide clear and concise information in response to the user’s questions. The AI should be able to pick up a keyword regarding the users’ input and be able to provide information regarding that topic or keyword without any issue. If the information provided is too long and convoluted, the user will end up confused and therefore the AI will be deemed unreliable.</p>

<h3 class="left">Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p class="left">The software we need are coding programs such as Eclipse or IntelliJ which utilise Java as their core programming language. This can be used to code our AI to answer questions or provide information regarding the users’ concerns. When a keyword is entered into the AI chat, the AI will provide information regarding the users’ input to help make things clearer for the individual. The main hardware we need are computers or laptops where we can work on programming the AI. Then servers may be required so the AI can be uploaded onto them.</p>

<h3 class="left">Skills required</h3>
<p class="left">Some skills required are knowledge of coding techniques in Java as it will be the source of the AI program to be implemented. Another skill necessary is the ability to create surveys or interact with the public because while working on the AI, user feedback is important to improve different aspects of the AI. These skills aren’t necessarily hard to find as there are people who work in these environment and have extensive knowledge of what is required to be done. </p>

<h3 class="left">Outcome</h3>
<p class="left">The outcome is to deliver the best service possible to users’ in relation to FAQs implemented via an AI. The AI should be able to answer and provide clear and concise information to users’ questions. The ability for an AI to answer user questions allows for efficient delivery of information within an adequate timeframe for users. With this being implemented, it doesn’t require human personnel to answer users’ questions and its highly convenient to have an AI answer the questions instead.</p>
